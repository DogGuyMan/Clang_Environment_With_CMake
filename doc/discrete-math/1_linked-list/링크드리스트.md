- ### Linked Lists
    - [x] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.

    - [x] Implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [x] size() - returns the number of data elements in the list
        - [x] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [x] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [x] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [x] pop_front() - remove the front item and return its value
        - [x] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [x] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [x] front() - get the value of the front item
        - [x] back() - get the value of the end item
        - [x] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so the current item at that index is pointed to by the new item at the index
        - [x] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [x] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at the nth position from the end of the list
        - [x] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [x] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value

        - No need to implement
