- ### Queue
    - [x] [Queue (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/queues-EShpq)
    - [x] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [x] [[Review] Queues in 3 minutes (video)](https://youtu.be/D6gu-_tmEpQ)
    - [x] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at a position at the tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [x] Implement using a fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
          *
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [x] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using a linked list where you enqueue at the head and dequeue at the tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal of each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

- ### Hash table
    - [x] Implement with array using linear probing
        - hash(k, m) - m is the size of the hash table
        - add(key, value) - if the key already exists, update value
        - exists(key)
        - get(key)
        - remove(key)
